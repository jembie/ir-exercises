    "\n",
    "As we know from the previous exercise, **tokenization** is the task of splitting a text into meaningful segments, which are also known as **tokens**. One important detail here is: spaCy's tokenization is **non-destructive**, meaning that we can always reconstruct the original input from the tokenized output. Information such as **whitespaces** is preserved in the tokens and no additional information is neither added nor removed during tokenization.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In the very first step, the raw text is split on whitespace characters, similar to how **`text.split(' ')`** acts.\n",
    "2. Next, the tokenizer processes the text **from left to right**, performing two checks on each substring:\n",
    "   <br></br>\n",
    "   - **Does the current substring match a tokenizer exception rule?**: An example for this is: \"**`don't`**\" has no whitespaces, however, it should still be split into the two tokens \"do\" and \"n't\", while something like \"U.K.\" should always remain as one token.\n",
    "   - **Can a prefix, suffix or infix be split off?**: For example punctuation like commas, periods, hyphens or quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a match, the rule is applied and the tokenizer continues the loop, moving to the next substring.\n",
