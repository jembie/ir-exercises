    "\n",
    "As we know from the previous exercise, **tokenization** is the task of splitting a text into meaningful segments, which are also known as **tokens**. One important detail here is: spaCy's tokenization is **non-destructive**, meaning that we can always reconstruct the original input from the tokenized output. Information such as **whitespaces** is preserved in the tokens and no additional information is neither added nor removed during tokenization.\n",

    "<img src=\"../../images/lab02/spacy_tokenization.png\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the very first step, the raw text is split on whitespace characters, similar to how **`text.split(' ')`** acts.\n",
    "2. Next, the tokenizer processes the text **from left to right**, performing two checks on each substring:\n",
    "   <br></br>\n",
    "   - **Does the current substring match a tokenizer exception rule?**: An example for this is: \"**`don't`**\" has no whitespaces, however, it should still be split into the two tokens \"do\" and \"n't\", while something like \"U.K.\" should always remain as one token.\n",
    "   - **Can a prefix, suffix or infix be split off?**: For example punctuation like commas, periods, hyphens or quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a match, the rule is applied and the tokenizer continues the loop, moving to the next substring.\n",

    "Build the inverted index, where the key (or the index of the DataFrame, if you prefer to use pandas) represents each term we have collected, mapping it to a list of corresponding document IDs. Although our current model is not yet capable of ranking by relevance (since we lack the ability to measure numerically of how \"important\" a piece of text is for a given query) we still want to collect useful metadata such as **`Document Frequency`** and **`Total Term Frequency`** for our future improvements. For now, we do not need to store the frequency of each term within individual documents; in other words, our Postingslists will simply contain the list of document IDs.\n",
